## Summary
The **Arichain Manual Referral Tool** automates account creation on the AriChain testnet but requires user input for certain steps. When prompted, simply provide the invite code, email address, and OTP manually. 

This approach avoids restrictions caused by temporary email services and ensures smoother account creation. Each VPN IP allows the creation of up to 5 accounts. To maximize efficiency, switch your VPN server after creating 5 accounts. This tool saves time and ensures your credentials are stored securely.
